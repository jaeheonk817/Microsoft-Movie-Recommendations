# Microsoft Movie Recommendations

## Overview
As a data scientist, I have been tasked with providing recommendations for original content creation for a video streaming platform business venture for Microsoft. The video streaming industry is rapidly growing and is expected to continue to expand in the coming years. Changes in consumer lifestyles have contributed to this growth, and each platform is collecting a significant amount of daily user data. With its financial resources and successful business operations, Microsoft is interested in entering and leading the studio business. This project will involve exploray data analysis and creating visualization to inform my advice to Microsoft.
## Business Understanding
* The project will focus on creating original content for streaming platforms, as opposed to purchasing or renting existing content.
* The objective of this project is to provide detailed guidance to Microsoft on what specific types of original contents to create that will enable them to establish a successful streaming platform.
## Data Understanding and Analysis
### Data Understanding
- The data used in this project is sourced from various websites, including IMDb Database, The Movie Database, Rotten Tomatoes, Box-Office-Bombs, and The Numbers for movie budget data.
- The data was thoroughly cleaned and then combined to create a comprehensive dataset with a sufficient number of data points.
### Analysis
- After conducting initial analysis using visualization tools provided by the pandas and seaborn libraries, I focused on the 'high budgeted movies' category as it was the only category with a significant return on investment. I then conducted further research specifically on that category.
